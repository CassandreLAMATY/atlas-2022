{"id": "tx5qkx", "name": "Berserk", "description": "Guts is the main protagonist of the manga and anime Berserk. Here, he can be seen with his famous \"Dragon Slayer\" sword, alongside a plaque that reads \"RIP Miura\". Kentaro Miura, the creator of Berserk, died on May 6th, 2021. He has since had many tributes across the internet and media alike.\n\nThis piece started as an effort by the Berserk Pixel Art Discord to create a tribute toward their favorite mangaka. After forming an alliance with r/mylittlepony early on due to their very close proximity with each other, both groups helped to create the initial memorial which consisted of the RIP text, Dragon Slayer sword, and Chestnut Puck.\n\nHowever, later on, Twitch streamer Asmongold expanded on this art in an attempt to remove the MLP fandom from the canvas entirely. Despite their numerous attempts, the MLP fandom was not able to retake their initial spot, facing heavy resistance from both Asmongold's viewers as well as general place users (wanting to help maintain the art due to its high quality and sensitive subject matter). In the end, they were kicked out and forced to migrate east.", "links": {"website": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(manga)"], "subreddit": ["Berserk"]}, "path": {"22-47": [[597, 261], [594, 264], [594, 274], [597, 277], [691, 277], [694, 274], [694, 264], [691, 261]], "48-58": [[597, 261], [594, 264], [594, 274], [597, 277], [690, 277], [693, 275], [715, 275], [715, 296], [745, 296], [745, 269], [694, 269], [694, 263], [692, 261]], "T:0-1, 59-164": [[594, 202], [594, 277], [691, 277], [693, 275], [715, 275], [715, 296], [745, 296], [745, 269], [715, 269], [715, 275], [694, 275], [694, 219], [683, 219], [677, 213], [677, 202]]}, "center": {"22-47": [644, 269], "48-58": [729, 283], "T:0-1, 59-164": [632, 240]}, "_author": "gh:GeoDash897"}
