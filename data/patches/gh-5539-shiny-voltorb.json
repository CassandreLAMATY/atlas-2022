{"id": "u0usw4", "name": "Shiny Voltorb", "description": "Voltorb is a ball-like Electric-type Pokémon known to mimic Poké Balls and explode when approached. This is the Shiny form of Voltorb, a rare color variation, with most being red and white instead.\n\nVoltorb is seen here blending into the nearby Poké Balls. Hopefully it doesn't explode here. It was originally drawn in its normal red colors before changing to its Shiny blue colors.", "links": {"website": ["https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Voltorb_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"], "subreddit": ["PlacePokemon2"], "discord": ["k4gaPAma"]}, "path": {"T:0-1, 72-164": [[1013, 711], [1013, 705], [1014, 705], [1014, 704], [1015, 703], [1016, 703], [1017, 702], [1021, 702], [1022, 703], [1023, 703], [1024, 704], [1024, 705], [1025, 705], [1025, 711], [1024, 711], [1024, 712], [1023, 713], [1022, 713], [1021, 714], [1017, 714], [1016, 713], [1015, 713], [1014, 712], [1014, 711]]}, "center": {"T:0-1, 72-164": [1019, 708]}}
