{"id": "twvb98", "name": "Littlepip", "description": "Littlepip is the main character of Fallout: Equestria, a post-apocalyptic crossover fanfiction between Fallout and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.\n\nAfter being written by Kkat in 2011, Fallout: Equestria spawned one of the largest sub-fandoms within the brony fandom, inspiring countess artworks, animations, music, video games, and spinoff stories- basically creating an extended universe within of itself. It also became famous as being one of the longest pieces of self-published fanfiction ever written.\n\nLittlepip's name partially comes from her talent working with \"Pipbucks\", the Fallout Equestria universe's equivalent to Fallout's \"Pipboy\". It is also a reference to the Lil' Pip 3000 from Black Isle Studio's canceled Fallout 3 (commonly known as Fallout Van Buren).", "links": {"website": ["https://falloutequestria.fandom.com/wiki/Littlepip", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_Equestria"], "subreddit": ["falloutequestria"]}, "path": {"153-164": [[542, 274], [536, 274], [536, 280], [542, 280]]}, "center": {"153-164": [539, 277]}, "_author": "gh:GeoDash897"}
