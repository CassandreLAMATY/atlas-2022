{"id": "twqrbr", "name": "Derpy Hooves", "description": "Derpy is a background character from the TV series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Derpy was first noticed by fans in 2010 for her cross-eyed look in the pilot episode of the show, and became a fan favorite ever since.\n\nThis Derpy art was not constructed by r/mylittlepony or the Manechat Discord server, instead being created by the Russian streamer Bratishkinoff during the last day of r/place. While this was initially caused panic from the MLP fandom as they feared a last minute raid from Twitch streamer Mizkif, Bratishkinoff helped to distract Mizkif up until the last moments of r/place, ensuring that the fandom's artworks were part of r/place history.", "links": {"website": ["https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Derpy", "https://www.twitch.tv/bratishkinoff"]}, "path": {"T:0-1, 109-164": [[907, 1701], [899, 1689], [897, 1684], [898, 1678], [901, 1677], [903, 1677], [903, 1674], [904, 1673], [904, 1672], [903, 1672], [893, 1664], [895, 1661], [898, 1659], [902, 1661], [903, 1660], [903, 1658], [899, 1655], [898, 1654], [893, 1649], [893, 1646], [894, 1644], [901, 1646], [902, 1647], [904, 1643], [907, 1636], [904, 1636], [899, 1641], [900, 1636], [905, 1629], [906, 1628], [904, 1626], [911, 1623], [915, 1622], [930, 1621], [939, 1625], [942, 1621], [944, 1621], [951, 1631], [952, 1641], [950, 1654], [953, 1654], [959, 1648], [968, 1646], [972, 1646], [976, 1647], [978, 1649], [978, 1652], [976, 1654], [971, 1658], [966, 1656], [956, 1656], [954, 1658], [956, 1660], [960, 1661], [964, 1663], [964, 1670], [967, 1672], [965, 1674], [964, 1678], [962, 1682], [957, 1681], [954, 1684], [953, 1686], [954, 1694], [955, 1696], [954, 1698], [953, 1703], [951, 1708], [951, 1713], [951, 1717], [948, 1722], [945, 1723], [936, 1724], [930, 1721], [924, 1717], [923, 1703], [928, 1695], [928, 1692], [922, 1693], [918, 1694], [918, 1697], [914, 1702], [911, 1702]]}, "center": {"T:0-1, 109-164": [929, 1667]}, "_author": "gh:GeoDash897"}
