{"id": "000367", "name": "Rainbow Dash", "description": "Rainbow Dash is one of the main ponies (Mane 6) of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. She represents the element of loyalty, and is depicted here saluting to the future and to the world.\n\nThis artwork was part of the first piece of art that the MLP fandom worked on at the start of r/place. However, after getting decapitated by the Ukraine flag numerous times and being raided by various Twitch streamers early on, the MLP fandom was forced to move and rework this artwork multiple times until it reached its final iteration as shown. This depiction of the element of loyalty and the caption below it now stand as a representation of the fandom's will to persevere despite the end of Friendship is Magic in 2019.", "links": {"website": ["https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Dash"], "subreddit": ["mylittlepony"], "discord": ["manechat"]}, "path": {"82-84": [[1808, 450], [1795, 460], [1795, 465], [1788, 473], [1788, 474], [1803, 487], [1803, 496], [1850, 496], [1849, 488], [1842, 483], [1832, 483], [1825, 486], [1821, 486], [1827, 478], [1827, 452]], "T:0-1, 111-164": [[925, 1830], [892, 1830], [892, 1885], [961, 1886], [961, 1830]]}, "center": {"82-84": [1810, 472], "T:0-1, 111-164": [927, 1858]}, "_author": "gh:GeoDash897"}
