{"id": "tx852n", "name": "Bidoof", "description": "Bidoof (Japanese: ビッパ Bippa) is the Normal-type Plump Mouse Pokémon introduced in the games Pokémon Diamond & Pearl. A variety of factors like its common nature, its oft-used convenience as an 'HM Slave' in teams, and its goofy name have given it a memetic status and adoration from Pokémon fans. Its heart-shaped nose shown here is not characteristic of its usual appearance.", "links": {"website": ["https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bidoof_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"], "subreddit": ["PlacePokemon2"], "discord": ["k4gaPAma"]}, "path": {"T:0-1, 109-164": [[553, 1467], [549, 1471], [551, 1476], [546, 1480], [547, 1488], [555, 1500], [560, 1499], [560, 1497], [566, 1497], [568, 1499], [574, 1499], [573, 1496], [578, 1492], [580, 1495], [587, 1495], [590, 1465], [584, 1460], [577, 1459], [567, 1465], [558, 1469]]}, "center": {"T:0-1, 109-164": [567, 1482]}}
