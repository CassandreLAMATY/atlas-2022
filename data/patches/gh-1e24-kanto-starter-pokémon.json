{"id": "txgtig", "name": "Kanto starter Pokémon", "description": "The starter Pokémon of the Generation I Pokémon games (Pokémon Green, Red, and Blue), obtained from Professor Oak's laboratory at the start of the game.\n\nThis piece was initially just the Water-type Squirtle created by a group of floormates at Western Washington University. After finishing the Squirtle, the Fire-type Charmander and Grass/Poison-type Bulbasaur were added by other Pokémon fans without any instruction. A true piece of community work, with almost no official collaboration. A Pikachu was a part of the piece at one point; however, that later got removed for other works.", "links": {"website": ["https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Starter_Pok%C3%A9mon#Kanto"], "subreddit": ["PlacePokemon2"], "discord": ["k4gaPAma"]}, "path": {"111-142": [[1817, 1], [1813, 5], [1813, 8], [1815, 10], [1815, 12], [1820, 18], [1824, 19], [1847, 19], [1848, 20], [1892, 20], [1894, 18], [1894, 15], [1898, 12], [1898, 5], [1899, 4], [1899, 2]], "83-110": [[1817, 1], [1813, 6], [1813, 8], [1819, 16], [1824, 19], [1847, 19], [1848, 20], [1850, 20], [1851, 19], [1873, 19], [1879, 13], [1879, 6], [1873, 1]], "T:0-1, 143-164": [[1817, 1], [1813, 6], [1827, 32], [1829, 33], [1838, 33], [1839, 34], [1841, 34], [1846, 29], [1852, 18], [1852, 16], [1858, 8], [1858, 5], [1854, 1]]}, "center": {"111-142": [1856, 11], "83-110": [1827, 10], "T:0-1, 143-164": [1836, 16]}}
