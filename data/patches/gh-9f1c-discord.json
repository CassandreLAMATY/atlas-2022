{"id": "twqwya", "name": "Discord", "description": "Discord, the spirit of chaos and disharmony from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.\n\nAfter his initial appearance in the Season 2 premire \"The Return of Harmony\", Discord became cemented into the MLP fandom due to the charismatic and chaos-loving nature of both himself and his voice actor, John de Lancie. This connection is fitting as Discord was inspired by John de Lancie's character Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\nThis art was created by a few Manechat Discord members as a part of a subtle attempt to expand the MLP fandom's influence on r/place, deciding to build in the Void to best reflect the Lord of Chaos' character. Soon after its creation, a small Fluttershy art was created nearby to highlight Discord's key friendship in the show.\n\nDiscord would remain here until the end of r/place, even getting recognized by the Void itself in the process.", "links": {"website": ["https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord"], "subreddit": ["mylittlepony"]}, "path": {"T:0-1, 109-164": [[1079, 1524], [1080, 1525], [1081, 1523], [1080, 1520], [1082, 1517], [1081, 1516], [1077, 1519], [1076, 1516], [1074, 1516], [1075, 1522], [1072, 1523], [1073, 1526], [1071, 1527], [1076, 1534], [1072, 1544], [1079, 1544], [1080, 1539], [1082, 1544], [1085, 1545], [1085, 1541], [1092, 1542], [1090, 1538], [1084, 1536], [1090, 1526], [1085, 1522]]}, "center": {"T:0-1, 109-164": [1081, 1531]}, "_author": "gh:GeoDash897"}
